# Calendlyr

The simplest way to interact with [Calendly's API v2](https://developer.calendly.com/api-docs) in Ruby. No dependencies, no complexity — just a Personal Access Token and you're good to go.

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "calendlyr"
```

Then run `bundle install`. That's it.

## Quick Start

```ruby
client = Calendlyr::Client.new(token: ENV["CALENDLY_TOKEN"])

# List your scheduled events
events = client.events.list(user: "https://api.calendly.com/users/YOUR_USER_UUID")
events.data
#=> [#<Calendlyr::Event>, #<Calendlyr::Event>, ...]

# Access event details naturally
event = events.data.first
event.name       #=> "30 Minute Meeting"
event.status      #=> "active"
event.start_time  #=> "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000000Z"

# List invitees for an event
invitees = client.events.list_invitees(uuid: event.uuid)
invitees.data.first.email  #=> "john@example.com"
```

The gem mirrors the Calendly API closely, so converting API examples into gem code is straightforward. Responses are wrapped in Ruby objects with dot-access for every field.
